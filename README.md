#  Sales Analytics Project (Excel + Power Pivot)

##  Business Problem
Sales teams and management often struggle to extract meaningful insights from raw sales data. This project addresses the following business needs:

- Clear visibility into **net sales performance**
- Identification of **top-performing and underperforming products**
- **Market-level comparison** against defined sales targets
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) growth analysis**

Raw sales data alone cannot answer these questions without proper data modeling, transformation, and analytical logic.
